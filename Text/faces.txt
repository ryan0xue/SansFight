4 it's a beautiful day outside.
4 birds are singing, flowers are blooming...
4 on days like these, kids like you...
5 Should be burning in hell.
3 what? you think i'm just gonna stand there and take it?
0 our reports showed a massive anomaly in the timespace continuum.
0 timelines jumping left and right, stopping and starting...
4 until suddenly, everything ends.
4 heh heh heh...
5 that's your fault, isn't it?
1 you can't understand how this feels.
4 knowing that one day, without any warning...
2 it's all going to be reset.
2 look. i gave up trying to go back a long time ago.
4 and getting to the surface doesn't really appeal anymore, either.
4 cause even if we do...
5 we'll just end up right back here, without any memory of it, right?
1 to be blunt...
4 it makes it kind of hard to give it my all.
4 ... or is that just a poor excuse for being lazy...?
2 hell if i know.
2 all i know is... seeing what comes next...
1 i can't afford not to care anymore.
4 ugh... that being said...
4 you, uh, really like swinging that thing around, huh?
4 ...
0 listen.
4 i know you didn't answer me before, but...
1 somewhere in there. i can feel it.
4 there's a glimmer of a good person inside of you.
3 the memory of someone who once wanted to do the right thing.
0 someone who, in another time, might have even been...
4 a friend?
2 c'mon, buddy.
3 do you remember me?
4 please, if you're listening...
3 let's forget all this, ok?
5 just lay down your weapon, and...
4 well, my job will be a lot easier.
1 welp, it was worth a shot.
1 guess you like doing things the hard way, huh?
3 sounds strange, but before all this i was secretly hoping we could be friends.
3 i always thought the anomaly was doing this cause they were unhappy.
4 and when they got what they wanted, they would stop all this.
5 and maybe all they needed was... i dunno.
5 some good food, some bad laughs, some nice friends.
4 but that's ridiculous, right?
4 yeah, you're the type of person who won't EVER be happy.
3 you'll keep consuming timelines over and over, until...
3 well.
3 hey.
3 take it from me, kid.
4 someday...
1 you gotta learn when to QUIT.
4 and that day's TODAY.
3 cause... y'see..
3 all this fighting is really tiring me out.
1 and if you keep pushing me...
3 then i'll be forced to use my special attack.
4 yeah, my special attack. sound familiar?
3 well, get ready. cause after the next move, i'm going to use it.
5 so, if you don't wanna see it, now would be a good time to die.
1 well, here goes nothing...
1 are you ready?
1 survive THIS, and i'll show you my special attack!
